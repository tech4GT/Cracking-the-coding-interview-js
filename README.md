# What?
These are my solutions to Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell's `Cracking the coding interview` in javascript. As of now I am working through the moderate and hard problems in the book.

# Optimized?
I am by no means a competetive programmer nor do I claim that these are the best or most optimized solutions.
